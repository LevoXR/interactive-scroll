## 💡 How It Works

This demo uses [CSS scroll snap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap/Basic_concepts) on a vertical container. Each category is a 100vh section, so scrolling locks the viewport to the next one. No extra libraries needed.

---

## 🎨 Customization

- Change background colors and text in `style.css`.
- Add more sections or content blocks in `index.html`.
- Responsive, so it works out of the box on most devices.
