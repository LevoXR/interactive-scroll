# Scroll Snap Demo

This project lets you demo and learn about CSS scroll snap by easily scrolling between category pages (Home, Vlog, Services, Help), each filling the screen.

## Try It

Simply open `index.html` in any browser. Scroll down/up with your mouse, trackpad, or arrow keys to jump between categories.

## How It Works

- Uses [CSS scroll snap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap/Basic_concepts) for smooth, locked vertical page switching.
- Each section snaps to the viewport edgeâ€”no JavaScript needed.
